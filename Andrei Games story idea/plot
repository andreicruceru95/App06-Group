-Player enters name-

Welcome young adventurer "name", this is where your story begins.

You find yourself in the last settlement of humankind.

In this land of trepidations you must slay your way though the now uncharted territory
and retrieve the mythical stone and place it back in the centre of town where it belongs.

Upon your quest you will have to fight monsters, upgrade your gear and level up.

(you have the monster scaling with levels, is this possible with the player? if so
i know we talked about the equipment stats as well, would it be possible for them to add
a rng [randomly generated] number to attack for the sword, defence for armour, potion with a static increase value to restore health
and maximum dose capacity, amulet to increase the chance of hitting the monster twice before getting hit back)

{this gives the player a clear objective on how to complete the game, and a
general idea on progression without providing to much information to spoil it}

Guard at the gate "ahh, young adventurer, while I was having a drink in the pub last night I overheard some shady characters
talking about a teleporter somewhere in the north of the forest"
{this directs the player on where they should go next}

~upon seeing the Blacksmith "This is where you can upgrade your equipment to provide a better chance of survival"

~upon seeing the shop "This is where you can restock your health potion"
(you would have to give the health potion an int for uses)

~upon seeing the teleporter "This must have been what the guard was talking about, I need to make sure i'm ready before going through"

~upon going through the teleporter "you see a corpse of a previous adventurer, maybe I should see if he had any notes"

~ when at the corpse "you find a journal, it reads:

I've made it this far, however I don't know how much further I can go on, somewhere south should be another teleporter but that leads into the spiders den.
I think they're the ones that are keeping guard over the mythical stone. I pray that someone is able to carry on my quest and save humanity. To any unfortunate adventurer that reads this, i've stashed some health potions
near the rocks west between the two trees (Andrie, I'll need to talk to you on the layout of this as i can explain in this doc) I wish you all the best and god speed"
