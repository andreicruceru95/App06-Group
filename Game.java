/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, console based game.  
 *  It's a world of monsters, where a young warior must fight to grow 
 *  so he can defeat tougher and tougher evils.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
